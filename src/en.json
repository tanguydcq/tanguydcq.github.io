Then, the model evaluated the contract type based on legal or structural criteria.\nI implemented a system to group contracts into families, handling ambiguous or conflicting cases with targeted follow-ups or additional prompts to clarify context.\n\nOne advantage of this approach is that it doesn’t require training a supervised model on a specific dataset.\nThis makes it much easier to adapt to new contracts with different structures or layouts while maintaining consistent classification.\nBy using well-crafted prompts, the LLM focuses on content rather than form, which improves the system’s generalization capability.\n\nThis project laid the groundwork for an internal tool capable of automating a typically manual task, while keeping the process transparent and explainable."

      "longDescription": "This project provides a full PyTorch implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), aiming to generate images from pure noise through an iterative denoising process.\n\nTwo different architectures are implemented depending on dataset complexity. For MNIST, a lightweight SimpleUNet is used to generate grayscale digit images. For CryptoPunks, a more advanced UNet architecture with self-attention mechanisms is employed to capture richer spatial dependencies in color images.\n\nThe project covers the entire experimental pipeline: diffusion and denoising processes, multiple training configurations, training and inference scripts, and visualization tools. GIFs are generated to illustrate both the forward noising process and the reverse sampling procedure.\n\nTraining is monitored using TensorBoard, tracking key metrics such as MSE loss, gradient norms, learning rate, and generated samples across epochs. A Streamlit web interface is also provided to launch training sessions, explore checkpoints, and generate images interactively.\n\nThis project demonstrates a strong understanding of diffusion-based generative models, modern UNet architectures with attention, and the implementation of reproducible deep learning workflows."

      "longDescription": "This project addresses the RPC problem, a realistic logistics optimization scenario inspired by national-scale transportation of goods using specialized vehicles. The objective is to efficiently pack a set of 3D objects with varying dimensions into trucks, minimizing the total number of vehicles while respecting their physical constraints.\n\nThe problem is modeled as a variant of the 3D bin packing problem, with an additional delivery order constraint (LIFO). The project is structured around several core components: a configurable data generator (Bronze, Silver, and Gold leagues), a solution visualizer, and an ad-hoc solver.\n\nThe implemented solver relies on a greedy First Fit Decreasing strategy, where objects are sorted by decreasing volume prior to placement. For each object, all possible rotations are evaluated to increase placement feasibility. Objects are then positioned using a heuristic that favors the lowest, leftmost, and deepest available coordinates to reduce space fragmentation.\n\nWhile the solver performs well on small to medium-sized instances, it struggles with larger and more constrained cases. LIFO constraints are not yet implemented, leaving room for future improvements such as local search methods or meta-heuristics including simulated annealing or genetic algorithms."

      "longDescription": "In this ongoing project, we are developing an AI-based tool to automatically analyze football matches from videos, with a clear goal: to provide detailed statistics to amateur clubs, often lacking advanced technological means.\nThe first phase focuses on player tracking. For this, we use YOLOv11, the latest version of the well-known object detection model. The tracking is done in three main steps:\nInitial object detection (players, ball, referees) on each frame with YOLO.\nInter-frame tracking based on spatial proximity: if two detected objects across consecutive frames are close, they are considered the same player. This step uses YOLO’s built-in tracking.\nRe-identification (Re-ID): to handle cases where a player leaves and re-enters the camera view, we generate a unique embedding for each player to assign them a constant ID throughout the match.\n\nWe use the SoccerNet dataset, which provides many annotated videos, allowing us to evaluate our tracking system in a supervised manner.\nAlongside tracking, we applied clustering techniques to identify referees and determine which team each player belongs to.\nThese first steps will lay the groundwork for later phases, aiming to detect match events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.) and automatically generate useful statistics for coaches and clubs."

      "longDescription": "This project was carried out as part of MLSecu module, with the objective of implementing different machine learning techniques to detect abnormal behaviors in an industrial system. The dataset used, SWaT (Secure Water Treatment), comes from an experimental water treatment plant that reproduces, on a small scale, a real purification process. This dataset includes both normal operation periods and simulated attacks targeting sensors and actuators, providing a rich ground for anomaly detection.\n\nThe first step of the project consisted in data preprocessing: removing missing and irrelevant values, normalizing variables, and visualizing correlations through a matrix. These steps ensured the quality and relevance of the data before training different models.\n\nTwo main families of approaches were explored:\n\nUnsupervised methods (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM), which can operate without labeled data but require careful tuning of the contamination rate. The comparative study showed that a majority-vote ensemble between models offered a good trade-off between recall and precision.\n\nSupervised methods (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression), which leverage the labels available in the dataset. Random Forest achieved the best overall performance, closely followed by SVM.\n\nFinally, a hybrid approach was discussed, combining the flexibility of unsupervised methods with the precision of supervised ones, in order to build a robust strategy adapted to dynamic industrial environments."

      "longDescription": "As part of an NLP project, I worked on a melody generator based on a method similar to natural language processing.\nThe idea was to treat music as a sequence of symbols, considering notes as letters or words, to predict the next note in a melody, similar to predicting the next word in a sentence.\n\nAs input, the model takes a chord progression (e.g., G, A, D, Em). For each chord, we extract the notes of its arpeggio, which provides a coherent harmonic base.\nFrom this base, the goal is to generate a melodic line that stays musical, respecting the chord progression while introducing some variation.\n\nTo model the sequence, I used a BERT-based model adapted to this musical representation.\nBERT is typically used to understand sentence context: here, it was used to understand the “harmonic context” and propose the most relevant continuation note by note.\nWith this approach, we get a melody anchored in the given chords, while allowing creativity in melodic progression."

We also went further by exploring other angles.\n\nSeveral models were tested, compared, and evaluated with appropriate metrics, and the results were interpreted using visualizations.\n\nThis project combines data processing, machine learning, and visualization skills to extract concrete insights from real-world data.\nYou can find all the details of the analysis and results in the following report:"
